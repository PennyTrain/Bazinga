### Typography

Bungee, sans-serif are being used to keep the website clear, the fonts were found using Google Fonts. 

### Color Scheme

* Day mode color scheme

* Night mode color scheme
![Screenshot of the night color contrast grid](./assets/imgs/testing.images/night-contrast-grid.png)

* In these screenshots it shows that a lot of the colors do not have a good contrast, therefore I got around this using a black opaque background with white text.

## Features

* Responsive on landscape device sizes.

* There is day and night modes in the game.

![Screenshot of homepage in day mode](./assets/imgs/readme.images/browser-day-homepage.png)

* The user can toggle between 3-5 games aswell as the day/night mode in the settings.

* In the rules, I have used icons instead of words to display the meaning. 

![Screenshot of the rules in day mode](./assets/imgs/readme.images/browser-day-rules.png)

* Along with this when a rule is hovered over it iSSncreases in size to be better displayed.

* The game box buttons light up blue when hovered over, along with text displaying above keeping score count. It also shows what exactly the player and computer picked.

* The buttons for the games are icons opposed to text. The rock is a diamond, because the best rock is a diamond!

### Future Enhancements

* In the future I wish enable users to make an account, therefore they can keep track of how many times they have one against the computer,

* In the future, I wish to incorporate some kind of score board, where it shows how well other players are doing vs yourself.

* In the future, I wish to enable difficulty levels.
